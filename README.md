# Project Euler 028 - Number Spiral Diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

    21 22 23 24 25
    20  7  8  9 10
    19  6  1  2 11
    18  5  4  3 12
    17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

The aim is to find the sum of the diagonals in an `n` x `n` spiral formed in the same way using HTML Forms and JavaScript.
